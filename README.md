# Bitmap Editor written in Golang
##### By Andrew M. Hall

### Overview
This program is a command line bitmap editor based on the ANU's comp2300 assignment 1. The functionality within allows the user
to crop, generate & threshold windows bitmaps through three tools: 'crop', 'gen' & 'tre'. This project has been mainly an
exploration into the power of Golang and as a Tutorial into its finer workings.
